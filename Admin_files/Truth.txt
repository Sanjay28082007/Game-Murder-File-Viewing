Howard, obsessed with control, orchestrated the entire murder. He instructed Maid 2 (Suzane) to force Alice to kill herself, using gloves and staged scenes to make it appear as suicide. He wiped CCTV footage, planted false evidence, and deleted her journals.
His motive? Alice had discovered his financial fraud and was preparing to expose him. The fake emails were red herrings to mislead the investigation.
