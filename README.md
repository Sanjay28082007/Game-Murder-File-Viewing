🕵️ Murder File Viewing Game (Python Project)

A Python-based file viewing game designed around a murder mystery theme.
This project demonstrates the use of multiple file types in a game-like setting, where players explore different files to uncover details, evidence, and clues.

The code has been uploaded, but the supporting files (required for full functionality) have not been uploaded yet. The project is still under development and will be given its final touch soon.

✨ Features

Works with several file types (to be uploaded later).

Menu-driven console interface for exploring murder-related files.

Simulates narrative exploration by opening and reading different data sources.

Demonstrates Python file handling in a creative, game-like way.

Replayable—different file paths and clues can be explored.
